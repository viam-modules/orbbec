# Build the viam-orbbec module
#
# We want a static binary, so we turn off shared. Elect for C++17
# compilation, since it seems some of the dependencies we pick mandate
# it anyway.

# We could just call `build` here with `--build=missing`, but we split this into two steps
# so we can ensure that all our dependencies are built consistently in `Release`, but that
# the actual module build gets built with an override to `RelWithDebInfo`, which we
# don't want to have accidentally affect our dependencies (it makes the build far too large).
# The override itself is derived from https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/12656.
